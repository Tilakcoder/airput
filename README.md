# Airput: Bridging the Digital Divide with AI-Powered Accessibility

Airput is a visionary project conceived during a high-energy hackathon, with the mission to break barriers for individuals with limited mobility. By harnessing cutting-edge computer vision techniques, we've crafted a solution that empowers differently-abled users to engage with personal computers using nothing but their facial and eye movements.

## Missing Files and Cloud Access

Due to some technical issues with LFS during the hackathon, certain essential files couldn't be uploaded to GitHub. Not to worry though! We've made them available in the cloud. Access them [on Gooogle Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tt3LSySjwovw0bLpRggGepRvA-KKxYiO?usp=sharing).

And here is our presentation on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvrkbkIL0/ZQPKm_uGB4Y0q7n-VTXx1g/edit?utm_content=DAFvrkbkIL0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

## Join Us in Shaping the Future

As we look ahead, we're excited about the potential of Airput. We're dedicated to transforming it into a full-fledged, open-source initiative and we're eager to welcome contributions from the vibrant tech community. If you're passionate about accessibility and inclusion, stay tuned! We'll be rolling out the welcome mat for contributors very soon.
